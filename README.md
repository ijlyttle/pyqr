What this thing does is revealing itself to me as I write it.
Although exciting, it seems sub-optimal.

I should take a deep breath and start to use these READMEs as aspirational documents that grow into "here's what it does" documents.



## Installation

### MacOS
```bash
xcode-select --install
```

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/fc4a19b38608451cabe6ceaa8ffb4fa1300854c8/install.sh)"
```

```bash
brew install ansible
```

## Usage

```bash
ansible-playbook local.yml -K --tags [R, python, quarto] 
```
